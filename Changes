Revision history for Lingua-EN-Titlecase

    - Took out Perl::Critic test file. It was causing failures in the
      CPAN tests even though it should skip if it's not installed.

    - Totally changed the guts. Now a lexer queue drives it instead of
      a single pass set of regexes. Looks a little spaghetti-ish but I
      think it'll clean up nice and allow for a lot of easy add-ons
      like dictionary hooks.
    - Added List::Util to get "first" token in queue which is wordish
      without a placeholding switch.
    - Cleaned up wordish/wc regex.
    - Mixed case terms with leading lowercase are now correctly
      preserved if they are below the built-in or user-set threshold.
    - Raised uppercase threshold from 0.9 to 0.95.
    - Lowered mixedcase threshold from 0.3 to 0.25 based on some test
      strings which show a pretty good breakpoint around 0.15.
    - Removed unused accessors.
    - A few small logic improvements in places like counting the real
      length of the string for computing mixedcase and uppercase
      ratios.

    - Changed the "apostrophe" to a single [[:punct:]]. This alters
      behavior quite a bit. Moo-ish and search.cpan.org are now one
      word. They were two and three before. Mixed case matches
      similarly differently too.
    - I think to deal with stuff like "iPods on eBay!" the titlecase
      method, and general handling, will have to be token-based. It
      gets too messy, too quickly otherwise.

    - Finding fault so quick: POD example updated with correct output.

    - Initial release. Champagne for everyone but the dogs! Sparkling
      wine for the dogs!
