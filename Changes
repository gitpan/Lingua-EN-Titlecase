Revision history for Lingua-EN-Titlecase

    - Changed the "apostrophe" to a single [[:punct:]]. This alters
      behavior quite a bit. Moo-ish and search.cpan.org are now one
      word. They were two and three before. Mixed case matches
      similarly differently too.
    - I think to deal with stuff like "iPods on eBay!" the titlecase
      method, and general handling, will have to be token-based. It
      gets too messy, too quickly otherwise.
